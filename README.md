 üé® Pipeline Visualization for Credit Card Fraud Detection

### 1. **Data Collection**
   - **Source**: The data is gathered from **Kaggle** and stored in a **MongoDB** database.
   - **Description**: The raw data contains transactional information with features like `Amount`, `Time`, `Card Holder`, and an outcome variable `Fraudulent (1 or 0)`.

---

### 2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - **Handling Missing Data**: Missing values are imputed using techniques like **mean imputation** or **constant fill**.
   - **Feature Scaling**: Use **RobustScaler** or **StandardScaler** to scale numerical features and remove any skew caused by extreme values (e.g., transaction amount).
   - **Feature Engineering**: You can create new features such as the average transaction amount per user or the time between successive transactions.

---

### 3. **Train-Test Split**
   - **Train-Test Split**: Data is split into a training set (80%) and a test set (20%) using **scikit-learn's `train_test_split`**.
   - **Stratified Sampling**: Ensures that both classes (fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions) are well-represented in both training and testing sets.

---

### 4. **Model Training**
   - **Model Selection**: Train multiple models such as **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, or **XGBoost**.
   - **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate models using metrics such as **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1-Score**. Also, use **ROC-AUC** for model selection.
   - **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use **GridSearchCV** or **RandomizedSearchCV** to find the best hyperparameters for the model.

---

### 5. **Model Inference (Prediction)**
   - **Input Data**: Once the model is trained, you can deploy it to make predictions on new, incoming data.
   - **Output**: The model outputs whether a transaction is **fraudulent (1)** or **genuine (0)**.
   - **Thresholding**: The model output is compared against a threshold (e.g., 0.5) to classify transactions as fraud or non-fraud.

---

### 6. **Post-Processing**
   - **Actionable Alerts**: If a fraudulent transaction is detected, an alert can be triggered, or the transaction can be flagged for review.
   - **Logging**: Logs are stored for auditing purposes or further analysis.

---

### 7. **Deployment (Real-Time Prediction)**
   - The trained model is deployed as a **Flask API**, which can receive new data via HTTP requests and return predictions in real-time.
   - The API can be integrated with **e-commerce platforms** or **payment gateways** to make real-time fraud detection decisions.

### üñºÔ∏è Advanced Visuals (Tools You Can Use)

You can use tools like **Lucidchart**, **Draw.io**, or **Microsoft Visio** to create professional pipeline diagrams. These tools allow you to:

- **Add Icons & Visual Elements**: Make the diagram more interactive and visually appealing.
- **Color Code**: Different stages can be color-coded (e.g., blue for data collection, green for model training, red for deployment).
- **Annotations**: You can add short descriptions and key metrics at each step.

Here's a possible visual representation of the pipeline using Lucidchart:

1. **Data Ingestion (MongoDB)**
2. **Data Preprocessing (Imputation, Scaling)**
3. **Model Training**
4. **Evaluation & Tuning**
5. **Prediction**
6. **Real-Time Deployment (Flask API)**

### üìà Performance Metrics Visuals

For model evaluation, you can also show some **metrics visualizations** like:

- **Confusion Matrix**: A confusion matrix to show how well the model is classifying fraudulent vs. non-fraudulent transactions.
- **ROC Curve & AUC**: Show how well the model discriminates between classes.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, roc_curve, auc
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# After making predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Confusion Matrix
conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)

# Plot Confusion Matrix
plt.figure(figsize=(8,6))
sns.heatmap(conf_matrix, annot=True, fmt="d", cmap="Blues", cbar=False)
plt.title('Confusion Matrix')
plt.show()

# ROC Curve
fpr, tpr, _ = roc_curve(y_test, model.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1])
roc_auc = auc(fpr, tpr)

plt.figure(figsize=(8,6))
plt.plot(fpr, tpr, color='darkorange', lw=2, label=f'ROC curve (area = {roc_auc:.2f})')
plt.plot([0, 1], [0, 1], color='navy', lw=2, linestyle='--')
plt.xlim([0.0, 1.0])
plt.ylim([0.0, 1.05])
plt.xlabel('False Positive Rate')
plt.ylabel('True Positive Rate')
plt.title('Receiver Operating Characteristic')
plt.legend(loc="lower right")
plt.show()
