💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection Project
📝 Overview
Credit card fraud detection is a critical application in the financial industry, helping to identify and prevent fraudulent transactions in real-time. This project uses machine learning techniques to classify transactions as either fraudulent or genuine based on various features like transaction amount, time, and user behavior. By identifying patterns and anomalies in the transaction data, this system aids in reducing financial losses due to fraud.

The dataset used in this project comes from Kaggle and contains anonymized credit card transaction data, which is stored in MongoDB for efficient querying and processing.

🚀 Key Features:
Machine Learning Models: Implemented models to predict fraudulent transactions based on historical data.
Data Preprocessing: Techniques to handle missing values, feature scaling, and encoding.
Real-time Predictions: Integration with Flask to serve real-time predictions on new transactions.
Model Training: Pipeline for training, validating, and testing machine learning models.
💿 Installation
1. Set Up the Environment
First, create and activate a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
conda create --prefix venv python==3.8 -y
conda activate venv/
2. Install Requirements
Install the necessary dependencies from the requirements.txt file:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the Application
Start the application by running the following command:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
This will start the Flask web application, which serves the fraud detection model and handles user inputs for real-time predictions.

🔧 Built With
Flask: Web framework for Python to serve the model and handle HTTP requests.
Python 3.8: The programming language used for backend logic and machine learning.
Scikit-Learn: Machine learning library used for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
Pandas & Numpy: For data manipulation and numerical computations.
MongoDB: NoSQL database used to store the credit card transaction data.
🏦 Industrial Use Cases
This fraud detection system can be applied in a variety of industries:

Banking: To identify and prevent fraudulent credit card transactions in real-time.
E-commerce: To monitor and flag suspicious transactions on e-commerce platforms.
Payment Gateways: To enhance security for online transactions and reduce fraud risks.
Insurance: To detect fraudulent claims and reduce losses in the financial sector.
📊 Dataset
The dataset for this project was sourced from Kaggle and includes anonymized data about credit card transactions, such as transaction amount, time, and features derived from user behavior.

🔮 Future Improvements
Real-time Analytics: Implementing a dashboard for live fraud detection monitoring.
Enhanced Models: Exploring other machine learning models like Random Forest, XGBoost, and deep learning approaches.
User Interface: Developing a web interface for users to input transaction details and get real-time fraud predictions.
